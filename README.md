# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer  

An interactive Python-based visualization tool for understanding how sorting algorithms work.  
This project animates step-by-step sorting operations using **Matplotlib**, making it easier to understand how each algorithm behaves internally.

## 🚀 Features

- Visualizes popular sorting algorithms  
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Quick Sort  
- Clean and simple UI  
- Color-coded comparisons and swaps  
- Adjustable speed (FPS)

## ✨ My Enhancements (Fork Improvements)

This project is a fork that I have extended and improved with:

- 📘 Improved documentation & explanations  
- 🎨 Updated and modernized color scheme  
- 📊 Added **Time & Space Complexity Table**  
- 🧠 Added algorithm descriptions for easier understanding  
- 🔧 Cleaned up code structure for readability  
- 📝 Enhanced README with screenshots, installation steps & future plans  
- 🧩 Planned addition: **Merge Sort visualization**

## 🧠 Algorithms Included

### 1. Bubble Sort  
Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if out of order.

### 2. Selection Sort  
Finds the minimum element and moves it to the correct position.

### 3. Insertion Sort  
Builds the sorted array one element at a time.

### 4. Quick Sort  
Uses divide-and-conquer and partitioning to sort large arrays efficiently.

## 📊 Time & Space Complexity

| Algorithm      | Best        | Average     | Worst       | Space |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **Bubble Sort**    | O(n)        | O(n²)       | O(n²)       | O(1)   |
| **Selection Sort** | O(n²)       | O(n²)       | O(n²)       | O(1)   |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n)        | O(n²)       | O(n²)       | O(1)   |
| **Quick Sort**     | O(n log n)  | O(n log n)  | O(n²)       | O(log n) |
